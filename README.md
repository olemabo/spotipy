# spotipy
Scripts that utilize the spotify Web API. 
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-apii/
# Spotipy will also be used, which is the lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API. With Spotipy you get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform.

# The main focus with this project is to create easy and quick terminal code to achieve maximum Spotify experience from terminal (which is what we all want). 

# The goal is to provide one sinlge python file which provides a terminal interface where different spotify functions are provided. This can be to search for artists, add current songs to queue, modify playback and so on. This will be found in everything.py. As with all the scripts, commenting, grammar skills, puns and coding skills, they will continuously be improved. 

# The individual scripts are best served with a nice alias :)
